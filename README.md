# Bradley-Fayyard-Reina-Algorithm

I write the K-Means and Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithms from scratch. You should implement K-Means as the main-memory clustering algorithm that you will use in BFR. You will iteratively load the data points from a file and process these data points with the BFR algorithm. See below pseudocode for your reference.
